    <p> I have many interests when it comes to things outside of working. These fall under the category of baking, drawing and at the side, and lastly playing guitar. These interests come from many inspirations that i've gotten from online. </p>

    <p>My first interest, when it comes to baking comes from dessert shops. I've passed many shops in manhattan the few times I go. I see the way people decorate cakes and make them look pretty. Putting fruits along the top, Stylizing whipped cream, all of those were big inspirations that told me I should bake one day. I chose to go from basic cake mix boxes into cake mixes all from scratch.</p>
